# Lesson 1: Your First Code

In this lesson, we will write our first command. We will tell the computer to speak.

### The "Print" Command
In Python, if you want the computer to say something, you use `print()`.

**Example:**
`print("Hello World")`

### Try it yourself!
Click the **Run** button (the Play icon) below. You don't need to install anything.
